# INTRODUCTION
Tyre health is crucial for road safety, and early detection of defects is vital for preventing accidents. Traditional methods of tyre inspection often rely on manual visual assessments, which can be time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error. This project explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for automated tyre defect classification, leveraging a dataset of 1854 digital tyre images which is available on https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/bn7ch8tvyp/1. 

The provided dataset offers a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the transportation and automotive sectors. Each image is labelled as either "defective" or "good condition," encompassing a total of two classes. This data allows for the training and testing of machine learning models capable of identifying tyre health from digital images.
The successful development of a CNN-based classification system for tyre defects holds significant promise. Potential benefits include:
•	Enhanced Quality Control: Automating defect detection can significantly improve the tyre industry's quality control processes, ensuring consistent and reliable assessments.
•	Reduced Accident Risk: Early identification of defective tyres can prevent accidents caused by tyre failure, leading to improved road safety.
•	Increased Efficiency: Automating inspections can streamline the process, saving time and resources compared to manual methods.
This project investigates the feasibility of utilizing CNNs for tyre defect classification. By training a model on the provided dataset, the project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and contribute to the development of more accurate and efficient tyre inspection systems.
